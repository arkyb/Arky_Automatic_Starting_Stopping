# Arky_Automatic_Starting_Stopping
This is the repository for the paper "Automatic Starting and Stopping of Autonomous Motorcycles: A Simulation Study."

To reproduce results presented in the article, open the world file ./Webots/worlds/Starting_Stopping.wbt in Webots version 2022a. If desired, ensure that video recording is enabled in MC_Supervisor.py by uncommenting the specified lines and saving the file. Press 'Reload World' (Ctrl + Shift + R) to begin testing. Data files are stored in the ./Webots/controllers/Yaw_Controller/Data subfolder. Videos are stored in the ./Webots/controllers/MC_Supervisor/Videos subfolder.

To see the model adapted from Meijaard, Papadopoulos, Ruina, and Schwab in ISO coordinates, see ./Webots/controllers/Yaw_Controller/RazorModel.py .
